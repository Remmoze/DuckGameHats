# DuckGame Hats

This is a tool to convert .png/.hat to .png/.hat files for the game [DuckGame](https://store.steampowered.com/app/312530/Duck_Game/)

## Adding a team

You are expected to give the site a .hat or .png file. If .hat file is given, it will automatically decode it and convert to a regular image.

## Test Sample teams

If you don't have any .hat files, you can access some sample hats by clicking the icon logo at the bottom right of the screen.

## Metapixels

(this feature is in alpha)
If hat has some metapixels, you can decode them by clicking the info icon
